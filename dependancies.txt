conda install -c anaconda pyqt5chart-I apologize for the confusion, but it seems that the list of modules and libraries you provided is incomplete. Some of the modules and libraries mentioned are part of the PyQt5 library, which you can install using the following command:

```shell
conda install -c anaconda pyqt
conda install -c conda-forge fpdf
conda install -c anaconda pyfiglet
conda install pyfiglet

pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools


conda list
conda clean --tarballs
conda clean --packages
conda clean --index-cache

conda clean --all

pip install requests
pip install psutil
pip install scapy
pip install 
pip install 
pip install 



conda install pyqt
conda install requests
conda install psutil
conda install scapy

from fpdf import FPDF

# Example usage
pdf = FPDF()
pdf.add_page()
pdf.set_font("Arial", size=12)
pdf.cell(200, 10, txt="Hello, World!", ln=True)
pdf.output("output.pdf")


Here is a list of external dependencies used in the provided code:

argparse: A standard Python library for parsing command-line arguments.

ipaddress: A standard Python library for working with IP addresses and networks.

logging: A standard Python library for logging messages.

os: A standard Python library for interacting with the operating system, such as handling file paths.

sqlite3: A standard Python library for working with SQLite databases.

sys: A standard Python library providing access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

threading: A standard Python library for working with threads.

requests: A third-party library for making HTTP requests.

scapy: A third-party library for crafting and sending packets, including ARP requests used for network scanning.

PyQt5: A third-party library for creating desktop applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Please note that PyQt5 may have additional dependencies itself, but they are not explicitly listed in the provided code. To use this code, you need to have all these dependencies installed in your Python environment. You can use conda or pip to install these packages.

conda install -c conda-forge scapy
conda install pyqt
conda install psutil
conda install requests

Install OpenSSL: Make sure you have OpenSSL installed on your system. If you haven't installed it, you can use the package manager of your operating system to install it. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
If you are using macOS, you can install OpenSSL using Homebrew:

Copy code
brew install openssl
If you are using Windows, you can download and install OpenSSL from the official website: https://www.openssl.org/

Reinstall cryptography: After installing OpenSSL, you can try reinstalling the cryptography library in your Anaconda environment:

css
Copy code
pip install --force-reinstall cryptography
The --force-reinstall flag will ensure that the library is reinstalled even if it's already present.

Update Environment: If the above steps don't work, you can try updating your Anaconda environment. First, activate the environment:

Copy code
conda activate myenv
Then, update the environment:

sql
Copy code
conda update --all
This will update all packages in the environment, including cryptography, which may help resolve the issue.

Create a New Environment: If the problem persists, you can try creating a new Anaconda environment with a clean slate and reinstalling all required packages from scratch.

lua
Copy code
conda create --name myenv python=3.9
conda activate myenv
pip install psutil requests pyqt5 scapy cryptography
This will create a new environment named myenv, activate it, and install all the necessary packages.

After trying these steps, run your script again to see if the issue is resolved. If you encounter any other errors or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
